# Credit-Card-Customer-Segmentation-A-Clustering-Approach

## Overview
This project aims to perform credit card customer segmentation using K-means clustering analysis on customer transaction data. By segmenting customers into  four distinct groups based on their spending behavior and demographics, financial institutions can tailor marketing strategies, improve customer satisfaction, and optimize business operations.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project (`BankChurners.csv`) contains information about credit card transactions, including transaction amount, transaction date, customer demographics, and other relevant features.

The feature set used in this project is as follows:
